Major Paper Overview
   1. What problem does your Major Paper address?
   2. Who is the primary audience or “client” for your Major Paper?
   3. What do you want the client to gain from your Major Paper?


        The aim of my Major Paper is to bring awareness to a socio-ecological issue that impacts both local environments and the communities that reside and interact with them. The encompassing concept I describe as “nature blindness,” and it impacts the overall health and well-being of both humans and the natural environment. Particularly, my focus is on highlighting nature blindness as a public health and environmental health issue that disproportionately impacts people and communities living in highly urbanized areas. The concept stems from the term “plant blindness,” credited by botanists and researchers James Wandersee and Elizabeth Schussler to explain individuals’ lack of interest and failure to notice plants within their immediate environment. 
There are two key audiences that are the focus of this project: environmental organizations that center community engagement and/or public environmental education, and residents of Rhode Island, particularly in the more urbanized parts of the state such as Providence. Community-based environmental organizations help facilitate a connection between people and the environment, and much of their work centers around engaging people in nature-based conservation, outdoor recreation, or climate resilience. While my target audience would be organizations based in Rhode Island, I hope that my research and findings could be extrapolated to environmental agencies elsewhere. Other audiences may include urban planners as well. The curriculum being developed will be aimed at residents as a mode of participation in environmental education programming, though my immediate audience for the paper itself will be local environmental organizations, in hopes that they will consider incorporating my workshop ideas into their own respective programming with the public. 
        My hope for this paper is that the target audience gains insight into how to increase community-led engagement with the environment and increase public awareness of the importance of local environmental stewardship. As environmental and climate crises grow in both frequency and scale of impact, I believe that individual and community-level connection/engagement with local ecological systems is essential to aiding conservation efforts. The aim for the first part of this paper is to raise awareness about nature blindness and how it contributes to biodiversity loss, especially in areas faced by greater environmental challenges like cities and highly urbanized areas. The aim for the second part of the paper is to provide a set of recommendations in the form of an environmental programming curriculum. With this curriculum, the goal is to then present it to some of the state’s environmental organizations closely tied to community engagement, so that these workshops can be presented to different audiences. The overarching aim is to help empower people to take actionable steps toward environmental sustainability by providing a variety of options to engage with nature, learn more about local biodiversity, and advocate for preservation of biodiversity in their neighborhoods.

Literature Review: Assessing Human-Nature Connectedness as a Measure of Environmental Literacy and Behavior


Introduction
        Coined by researchers James Wandersee & Elizabeth Schussler in 1999, the term “plant blindness” refers to “the inability to see or notice the plants in one’s own environment,” which leads to a more general inability to recognize important plants to one’s environment, appreciate the aesthetic biological features of the plant kingdom, and misguided perceptions of plants as somehow inferior to animals and humans (Wandersee & Schussler, 2001). Taking this term and expanding it further to include other elements of one’s environment – such as animals, insects, bodies of water, and local ecosystems – I aim to explore the idea of ecological literacy, and its impacts on individuals, communities, and societies. This is not only a crisis of connection; it is a crisis of environmental health, public health, and social justice. 
        The core aim of my paper is to raise awareness about the disconnection between humans – more specifically, those living in highly urbanized areas with little to no biodiversity – and the natural environment. In the modern-day era of rapid environmental degradation, depletion of natural resources, disappearance of local biodiversity, and extreme climate fluctuations, it is imperative that we become more aware of our impacts on the environment and seek out solutions that empower local ecosystems, while fostering stronger connections to nature. Earth is the only planet we have for sustaining the long-term existence and well-being of humanity, and thus we must protect, conserve, and restore the ecosystems as much as possible. 


Background
The connection between humans and the natural world has long been considered and written about, but more contemporary researchers have sought to examine the complex interactions and perceptions between post-industrial societies in the Western world dating back to the late 1940s and earlier. One of the most prominent ecologists, Aldo Leopold, wrote extensively on the ways that humans have come to perceive the natural world, and its implications for environmental degradation. In the late 1990s, researchers like Theodore Roszak followed in Leopold’s wake, emphasizing the notion that “feeling a sense of belonging to the broader natural community may be a prerequisite for increasing environmental protection” (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Both ecologists and ecopsychologists focused on understanding human-nature interactions, bridging together the fields of both ecology and psychology to study how people might develop a sense of belonging or community to the natural world, and how that connection might invoke a sense of environmental concern among the populace. The study of psychology and environmental sustainability presents a unique opportunity to study the influence of nature itself, in combination with human choices and behavior, on environmental sustainability; the two fields come together to create the socio-environmental science of ecopsychology. The concept of ecopsychology was originally coined by Theodore Roszak in his book The Voice of the Earth (1992), where he delves into the pressing environmental issues of the time, framed through a critical analysis of the U.S. emphasis on industrialization and technological advancement, at the detriment of both psychological and ecological well-being.
The relationship between one’s environmental behaviors and outdoor recreation have been of interest to researchers since at least the mid-1970s (Tiesl & O’Brien, 2003), such as Dunlap and Heffernan’s 1975 study on outdoor recreation and environmental concern. However, while the relationship between outdoor recreation and environmental behaviors has been studied, most of the research dates to around the mid-70s and, due to weak associations being found in those studies, the topic had reduced research interest over time (Tiesl & O’Brien, 2003). Despite this lag in research interest on human-nature connections, there has been a resurgence in the topic as studies in the late 90s and early 2000s have emerged to more closely understand the relationship using empirical evidence. Much of the academic discussion centered around naming and conceptualizing eco-social relationships, as there must first be a specific factor that researchers could measure on an individual and/or community scale. This gave rise to concepts like the connectedness to nature (CNS) scale, relatedness to nature scale, and other related terms. 
Over the late 90s and early 2000s, researchers have sought to develop terminology to both describe and measure the relationship between humans and the environment. A host of terms and concepts were created to examine individuals’ affinity for, connection to, relation with, identity toward, and inclusion of nature as a part of one’s sense of self and sense of belonging to the world. Kals, Schumacher, and Montada introduced the concept of emotional affinity toward nature– a term to refer to feelings such as a love of, and sense of oneness with, nature –and developed a 16-item measure to assess this affinity (Kals et al., 1999; Tam, 2013). This was one of the first measures developed to try to quantify affective attitudes toward the natural world. In 2001, Schultz introduced the concept of inclusion of nature in the self (INS), creating a single-item measure for the extent to which one’s core construction of the self includes knowledge and awareness of the natural world (Schultz, 2001). Mayer and Frantz developed the connectedness to nature scale (CNS), a 14-item measure that assesses the extent to which people feel connected to the natural world (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Lastly, the term commitment to nature (COM), reflects the idea that as humans depend upon nature, they may also experience a sense of attachment and concern toward nature, thus offering insights into ecological behaviors (Davis et al., 2009). Many of these concepts are used in quantitative and qualitative studies, which are highlighted in the “Data-Driven Approaches” section, using single-item and multi-item surveys to assess participants’ sense of connectivity or relatedness to nature. 
The linkage between humans and their emotional appeal toward nature has been proposed as part of the “biophilia hypothesis,” originally proposed by E.O. Wilson to explain an inherited human genetic tendency to respond to the environment, especially with specific emotional responses (Wilson, 1984). The biophilia hypothesis suggests that there is an innate, evolutionary biological basis for human values toward nature, arguing that connection to nature is a fundamental part of human behaviors. Of course, proving such a theory would be difficult from an evolutionary or genetic perspective, but there could be some possible credence to the theory from an eco-psychological standpoint, such as when studying the mental, physical, and communal benefits that the natural environment brings to people (i.e., ecosystem services). 
While connection to nature and sense of identity with the natural world is a measure that plays a role in influencing environmental behaviors, another factor I propose exploring is the role of environmental education in helping shift attitudes and perceptions. However, environmental education must center on more than mere acquisition or dissemination of knowledge about the natural world. Instead, as demonstrated in the findings of Pooley and O’Connor’s work, emotions and beliefs are what need to be targeted as the foundation of environmental programming (Pooley & O’Connor, 2000). The authors delve deeper into the mechanisms behind human behavior, citing prior studies that suggest there are three “domains” in which environmental responses are generated: affective, cognitive, and behavioral. Drawing on work conducted by Louis Iozzi, the authors emphasize the “key entry point” for environmental education lies in the affective domain, a central component for learning and evaluation, and “includes values and value systems that provide the basis for continued learning and for most of an individual’s overt behavior” (Iozzi, 1989). In the second part of my project, which consists of developing an environmental education curriculum aimed at improving attitudes and perceptions towards urban biodiversity, I will draw from environmental education research to tailor the curriculum to emphasize key values and concepts that are most likely to effectively engage the public and shift individuals toward more environmentally conscious behaviors within their own homes. 


Data-Driven Approaches
        As noted in the Background section, studies have sought to identify some kind of measure for assessing the extent of connectedness, emotional affinity, relatedness, and sense of belonging humans feel toward the natural world, and whether these features could influence one’s level of environmental concern. To measure and assess these values, studies have tested a variety of methods, models, and approaches to provide qualitative and quantitative data on the topic. Most significant studies took place around the early 2000s, with Teisl and O’Brien’s (2003) analysis of the relationship between outdoor recreation and environmental concern. Mayer and Frantz (2004) and Nisbet et al. (2009) developed the connectedness to nature scale and the nature relatedness scale, respectively, to explore the human-nature relationship in more detail. Lastly, Gong et al. (2024) examined the influence of nature connectedness to physiological factors among participants exposed to varying levels of biodiverse green spaces.
        Building upon studies like Dunlap and Heffernan’s 1975 work investigating outdoor recreation and environmental concern, authors Teisl and O’Brien used representative sampling and probability modelling to test the association between an individual’s participation in outdoor recreational activities and level of environmental concern or behaviors. Noting the “relatively weak associations found in previous work,” the authors aimed to statistically measure the level of influence of certain types of recreational activities on pro-environmental behavior, seeking to assess whether type of recreational activity may have significantly different effects (Teisl & O’Brien, 2003). They examined activities such as wildlife watching, hunting, photography, hiking, fishing, etc. and used regression analysis to estimate the likelihood that individuals may participate in pro-environmental behaviors like affiliation with an environmental organization or forest management, based on each type of activity. In order to quantify this association between recreation and behavior, Tiesl and O’Brien used four sets of equations to estimate associations between individuals’ participation in forest-based recreation and differing measures of environmental interest or behavior: level of membership or support for environmental groups; level of interest in forest management concerns; opinion on percentage of forests being managed in an “environmentally friendly” manner; and likelihood of purchasing an environmentally certified product. The results of this study support the hypothesis that “participation in outdoor recreation can have a significant positive association with both the level of environmental concern and the level of environmental behavior” (Dunlap & Heffernan, 1975; Tiesl & O’Brien, 2003). However, the results also showed that level of environmental concern and behavior varied across activities, implying that recreational activities should be individually analyzed to assess how they each affect the level of environmental behavior or concern exhibited by an individual. 
        Mayer and Frantz present the core reasoning for developing data-driven approaches to understanding socio-environmental relations. They posit that “measuring one’s affective sense of connectedness to nature is important for empirical progress to be made,” presenting and evaluating a scale measuring survey participants’ sense of connection to nature through several joint studies (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). The studies, which consisted of both student and community samples in Canada, supported the effectiveness of the CNS in demonstrating a strong positive correlation between an individual’s level of sense of connectedness to nature and ecologically-friendly actions, as well as suggesting a positive link between personal well-being and connectedness to nature (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Mayer’s and Frantz’s approaches to measuring connectedness to nature evolved from previous self-reported measures of individuals’ relationships to nature. Drawing from studies such as the new environmental paradigm (NEP) scale, the inclusion of nature in the self (INS) scale, and the implicit associations test (IAT), the authors created a multi-item, affective, predictive scale that provided advantages and further research implications that the previous researchers’ works could not. 
        In a dual study, researchers at Carleton University proposed another scale for assessing “the affective, cognitive, and experiential aspects of individuals’ connection to nature,” which became known as the Nature Relatedness (NR) scale (Nisbet et al., 2009). This scale provides an additional approach to measuring individuals’ extent of connectedness to the natural world, using a multi-item scale to assess several factors based on participants’ survey responses: internalized self-identification with nature, external worldviews toward nature, and level of individual familiarity, comfort, and desire toward being immersed in nature. Another interesting feature of Nisbet et al.’s study is that, unlike that of Mayer & Frantz’ work, they included executives from the federal government and private sector, in addition to undergraduate students. While this provides an additional range of public perspectives on a sense of connectedness to nature, both studies fail to include a larger and more diverse range of socioeconomic levels, professions, and community roles. 
        One of the most recent studies on nature connectedness was conducted in China, in which researchers conducted a mixed-design experiment assessing exposure to varying levels of biodiverse urban green spaces and health (Gong et al., 2024). Participants were exposed to three types of urban settings: urban gray space, low-biodiversity green space, and high-biodiversity green space. However, the researchers did not physically immerse the study participants in these three settings; rather, they had participants watch ten-minute video clips of the three spaces, which included audio: the sound of pedestrians and traffic at a popular shopping center for the urban gray space, the sound of wind at an artificial woodland park, and the sound of birds and wind at the edge of a woodland in Beijing Olympic Forest Park. Researchers measured nature connectedness using Nisbet et al.’s Nature Relatedness scale, and measured health and well-being indicators such as stress and cognitive function using physiological responses like skin conductance. The study goes beyond Mayer and Frantz and Nisbet el al.'s work by exploring the relationship not only between humans and nature through connectedness, but takes it a step further by adding the relationship between green spaces and health. It would be interesting to see future studies that measure nature connectedness and physical health factors among participants who are physically immersed in the varying types of green spaces, rather than merely watching and listening to video/audio recordings of such spaces. However, due to the time constraints of this project, I will simply be conducting a review of existing data and studies, not conducting any primary research of my own. The main focus of my paper will be understanding the various ways in which human connection to nature can be measured and how such factors may influence environmental literacy on an individual and community level. 
        
Conclusion
While there have been numerous studies investigating the relationship between humans and nature, there remains gaps in the existing literature that look at multiple socio-ecological associations: immersion in nature, connectedness (or relatedness) to nature, health impacts of biodiverse green spaces, and pro-environmental behavior through environmental education. It is a tall order to examine so many factors and the interrelation of humans, nature, and health. But future research must address a combination of these elements in order to understand how environmental behavior could be driven by direct exposure to nature, and how connecting to nature can impact the health of both humans and the environment. Applying concepts like the connectedness to nature scale, nature relatedness scale, and other related measures allows for direct survey of individuals’ sense of connection to nature, and examining the effect of outdoor recreational activities could help bridge gaps in knowledge on the link between direct exposure to nature and later development of environmental concerns and behaviors.

Proposed Methodology
For this project, I will be approaching the topic of nature blindness and urban biodiversity loss through two lenses: a research-based approach and an environmental education-based curriculum designed to engage communities in biodiversity-supporting practices. The research-based approach will consist of conducting a literature review and analysis to examine in detail the existing literature that addresses this topic, identify where gaps in the literature exist, and highlight recommendations and implications for future research on understanding the links between nature blindness and biodiversity within urban settings. My research will also focus on analyzing environmental education studies that address effective approaches to public engagement with science. The findings, recommendations, and discussions from the studies will be used to inform the curriculum development in the second portion of the project. I will also conduct an analysis of several environmental organization’s websites to examine how such entities target, educate, and engage with individuals and families. This website analysis will include reviewing informational materials, blog posts, articles, press releases, and resources that are based around connecting people to the natural environment.
To complete the curriculum portion of this project, I will be reviewing several different community-focused environmental education programs in order to learn best practices for creating informative, engaging content for workshop programming. I intend for the workshops I develop to be incorporated into existing programs that organizations are doing, or to open discussion for creating new initiatives based on the content. If the timeline for this project were longer, I would have been interested in assessing the curricula’s effectiveness by measuring participants’ level of environmental literacy before and after completing the workshops, and surveying participants to see how the activities may have shifted their perceptions of the natural world. This will be a point of discussion for future research implications, and could help inform my own research interests at a future time when I pursue a PhD or aim to work with local environmental organizations on strategic planning for environmental education. 
Upon completion of my paper, I hope to share my findings and proposed curriculum with interested organizations around Rhode Island that center on community conservation and stewardship. I will work with my advisor to propose ways to disseminate my findings with others, such as a presentation on campus, a speaking engagement at an environmental-based conference, or individual interviews with specific organizations of interest. This project, while it will be a culmination of my own research on the subject, is also an effort to engage directly with residents and community leaders in Rhode Island to better understand the ways in which the natural environment both shapes and is in turn shaped by the actions of individuals and societies.

Learning Goals
   1. What new knowledge do you hope to acquire?
   2. What skills do you hope to acquire or improve?
   3. What networking resources do you hope to acquire?
   4. What communication skills do you hope to acquire or improve?
   5. What quantitative or analytical skills do you hope to acquire or improve?


Over the course of this semester as I complete my project, I hope to gain or build upon several academic and professional skills. I aim to expand upon my research and analysis skills, practicing the key techniques needed by academics to thoroughly study and understand a topic, acquire appropriate sources to cite, and synthesize information from multiple sources, studies, and full-length articles. Through the project, I will practice digital rhetorical analysis, learning how to review different organizational websites to understand effective approaches, programs, and public communication strategies that are implemented to help increase community engagement with their local ecosystems. If the timeline for this project were longer and I were to obtain IRB approval, I would have liked to interview some of the environmental organizations around Rhode Island to speak directly with individuals about what kinds of organizational approaches are best for engaging communities, the kinds of demographic groups they target, and levels of engagement from community members (such as attending meetings or events, supporting environmental projects, volunteering, etc.). Instead, I hope to gather key insights and best practices through my review of online content and resources. 
With my background in communications work, I am familiar with and enjoy writing in different capacities for different audiences. The kind of language, tone, and information that is shared with the general public will be different from what is shared with legislators and elected officials. The kind of visual and written rhetoric that is used for increasing awareness or sparking engagement will vary across communities based on the level of local knowledge, primary spoken language, socioeconomic status, education level, religion, and so on. Each of these defining demographic characteristics has to be considered in order to know how best to connect with the individuals, families, and local residents of an area, and the values, culture/customs, beliefs, and circumstances that the community faces. Completing this project presents two writing exercises that will challenge me: disseminating information in a highly-organized, scientific, peer-reviewed audience; and developing educational materials for a public, local audience. 
I hope to learn about more environmental organizations around Rhode Island for my own awareness, but also to explore potential career opportunities and roles that interest me. Having worked with the WRWC, I first got my bearings on environmental communications, learning how the organization garners support and directly works within and alongside members of local watershed communities throughout the Woonasquatucket, especially the Olneyville residents in Providence and the Smithfield residents in the upper watershed. Being a participant in the NRICD Urban Growers Leadership Program, I gained first-hand experience in community-based environmental programming: the program provided various resources and support to help participants attend each workshop (i.e., childcare, food, transportation, interpretation services), and distributed materials that were educational and connected individuals to the gardening organizations and resources that exist around Providence. It is programs such as this, the URI Master Gardeners Program, the WRWC Recreation programs, and other such initiatives that improved my environmental literacy and inspired me to explore various activities that involve interacting with elements of the natural world. These experiences inspired me to develop a curriculum of my own, in hopes that such workshops will inspire a new generation of environmental stewards and people seeking out pro-environmental behaviors through developing a personal connection with nature.
